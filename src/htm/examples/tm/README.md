Temporal Memory Sample Code
=====

This directory contains a number of files that demonstrate how to use the
temporal memory algorithm directly.

The best place to start is hello_tm.py

WARNING: understanding these files requires building up a very detailed
knowledge of how the temporal memory works in HTM's. The documentation is not
great at this level of detail - any suggestions or help appreciated!
